# Architecture — Challazo Backend

This document describes the **current** backend: a FastAPI API that runs hackathons (rounds, teams, submissions), AI-assisted video evaluation, optional GitHub repository analysis, admin review, and per-round leaderboards.

API contracts and frontend handoff live in the [README](../README.md). This file is the system design.

---

## 1. What the system is

Students enroll in a published hackathon round (solo or team), submit a demo (video and/or form answers), and wait for evaluation. Admins assign **approved evaluators**. Evaluators score with a rubric, optionally run **Gemini** on the demo video and an external **GitHub analyser** on a repo URL, then submit for review. Admins approve (or request changes). Students see scores and ranking only after the admin publishes.

| Concern | Choice |
|---------|--------|
| Runtime | FastAPI (Python ≥ 3.11) on Cloud Run |
| Auth | Firebase Auth (Identity Toolkit login + Admin SDK verify) |
| Database | Cloud Firestore (schemaless; collection names are conventions) |
| Object storage | GCS (`EVALUATION_BUCKET_NAME`) |
| Video AI | Vertex / Gemini (`google-genai`, multimodal `gs://` URI) |
| Repo AI | External Cloud Run analyser (`GITHUB_AI_EVALUATION_URL`) |
| Email | Brevo SMTP (OTP + leaderboard notify); optional Firestore `mail` |
| Long jobs | Cloud Tasks → `POST /internal/jobs/evaluate-submission` (local: FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`) |
| Timezone | Asia/Kolkata (IST) for dates, windows, and timestamps |

There is **no Postgres**. Firestore is the system of record. Analysis does not use a separate job worker process — Cloud Tasks HTTP-POSTs back into **this** service.

---

## 2. Design principles

1. **Routes → services → I/O.** Handlers parse HTTP, call a service, map errors. They do not talk to Firestore or Gemini directly.
2. **`FirebaseService` is the only Firebase Admin client.** Never import `firebase_admin` in routes or domain services.
3. **One process-scoped container.** `AppContainer` in `app/dependencies.py` is built in lifespan and injected with `Depends`. Constructors still work without the container (tests, scripts).
4. **Sync I/O off the event loop.** Route handlers are `async def`; Firestore, GCS, SMTP, and Identity Toolkit run through `app.utils.async_io.run_sync` (`asyncio.to_thread`).
5. **Roles live on the Firestore user document**, not Firebase custom claims: `student` | `evaluator` | `admin`. Evaluators also have `approval_status`.
6. **Clients poll.** Video AI and GitHub AI return `202` and persist status on the submission; the SPA polls `GET /submissions/{id}`.

## 3. System context

The SPA never calls Gemini or the GitHub analyser. Signed GCS PUT URLs let the browser upload video straight to the bucket.

## 4. Process layers

```mermaid

  end

```

| Layer | Path | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| App factory | `app/main.py` | CORS allow-list + credentials, lifespan, routers, error handlers, `/` and `/health` |
| Routes | `app/routes/` | HTTP surface; `Depends` + `run_sync` |
| Auth | `app/middleware/auth_middleware.py` | Cookie/Bearer token, CSRF, role gates |
| Models | `app/models/` | Pydantic request/response (not Firestore schemas) |
| Services | `app/services/` | Business rules |
| Utils | `app/utils/` | IST time, GCS signed URLs, OTP, round helpers, CORS |
| Errors | `app/exceptions.py` | `AppError` hierarchy (`BadRequest`, `Unauthorized`, `Forbidden`, `NotFound`, `Conflict`, `TooManyRequests`, `InfrastructureError`) |

Startup (`lifespan`):

1. `init_app_container(app)` — Firebase, GCS client, all domain services.
2. Optional `DatabaseSeeder` when `SEED_ON_STARTUP` is true (default locally; false in production Cloud Build). Seed failures are logged and **do not** abort startup.

---

## 5. HTTP surface

| Router | Prefix | Audience |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `auth` | `/auth` | Login, cookies, CSRF, register + email OTP + phone verify |
| `admin` | `/admin` | Users, evaluator approve/list |
| `access` | `/admin/access` | Super Admin roles, permissions, and staff logins |
| `settings` | `/super-admin/settings` | Super Admin only: profile-password change, registration OTP toggles, deleting one hackathon and its submissions, and Reset Database. A wrong Profile Password is 400, so the login session stays. Admin and custom roles get 403. |
| `hackathon` | `/hackathons` | CRUD, drafts, round publish, **catalog**, leaderboard |
| `teams` | `/hackathons` | Round enrollment, create/join team, join codes |
| `submissions` | `/submissions` | Upload, assign, evaluate, GitHub AI, review, Sheets export |
| `theme` | `/themes` | Reusable problem themes |
| `university` | `/universities` | Admin catalogue; public list for student register |
| `evaluation_requirement` | `/evaluation-requirements` | Rubric / form field definitions |
| `evaluation_prompt` | `/ai-evaluation-prompts` | Gemini prompt templates |
| `metric_scoring` | `/ai-evaluation-metric-scoring` | Per-field scoring config |
| `internal_jobs` | `/internal/jobs` | Cloud Tasks worker (`X-Internal-Job-Secret`) — not the SPA |

Swagger (`/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`) is on in development and off in production unless `ENABLE_API_DOCS=true`.

## 6. Service graph

Built once in `build_app_container()`:

`HackathonExportService` and `GoogleSheetsExportService` are constructed per request from the same container (not stored as container fields).

### SubmissionService mixins

`app/services/submission_service.py` re-exports a façade composed in `app/services/submission/service.py`:

| Mixin | File | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `CreateMixin` | `create.py` | Multipart and signed-URL create; uniqueness |
| `QueryMixin` | `query.py` | ACL, enrichment, lists |
| `AssignmentMixin` | `assignment.py` | Assign evaluators; optional auto-AI enqueue |
| `AnalysisMixin` | `analysis.py` | Gemini video analysis → `analysis` + scorecard |
| `GithubAiMixin` | `github_ai.py` | Gemini context + external analyser |
| `ReviewMixin` | `review.py` | Submit-for-review / approve / request-changes / publish |

Shared collections and Gemini/GCS clients live on `SubmissionServiceBase`.

---

## 7. Authentication and authorization

### Login

`POST /auth/login` does **not** mint tokens with the Admin SDK. It calls Firebase Identity Toolkit `signInWithPassword` (`FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY`), checks `aud` / `uid` against the Firestore user, then sets:

- HttpOnly `access_token` cookie
- `csrf_token` cookie
- JSON body includes `csrf_token` (required for cross-origin SPAs; `document.cookie` cannot read the API cookie)

`Authorization: Bearer` still works for Swagger and non-browser clients.

### Request auth

`get_current_user`:

1. Cookie first, then Bearer header.
2. If the token came from the cookie and the method is mutating, require `X-CSRF-Token` matching the CSRF cookie (`CSRF_PROTECTION`).
3. Verify JWT (shape + project `aud`, then Admin SDK).
4. Load `users/{uid}`. A valid Firebase token **without** a Firestore user → 404.

| Dependency | Rule |
|------------|------|
| `get_current_user` | Authenticated |
| `get_active_user` | Evaluators must be `approved` |
| `get_student_user` | `role == student` |
| `get_evaluator_user` | `role == evaluator` and approved |
| `get_admin_user` | `role == admin` |

Pending evaluators may call `/auth/me`; other app routes return 403 until approved.

### Registration

Student and evaluator share one registration flow (`VerificationService`). Super Admin turns email OTP and mobile OTP on or off together for both roles (`app_settings/registration`, default both on):

1. `POST /auth/register/start` → `verification_sessions` doc
2. Email OTP via `EmailService` (Brevo in prod)
3. Firebase Phone Auth in the browser → `POST /auth/verify-phone-token`
4. `POST /auth/register/complete` creates Auth + Firestore user and sets the login cookies.
   Student complete requires `university_id` from `GET /universities` (public) and
   `batch_id` from `GET /universities/{id}/batches` for that same university. A batch
   from another university is `409 BATCH_UNIVERSITY_MISMATCH`. The user doc stores
   `university`, `university_id`, `university_location`, `batch_id`, `batch_name`,
   and `college_type` (`NIAT` or `Non NIAT`, copied from the university). A NIAT
   university requires `niat_id` (`400 NIAT_ID_REQUIRED`, `409 NIAT_ID_TAKEN`).
   A Non NIAT university requires `college_id` (`400 COLLEGE_ID_REQUIRED`).
   That college id is unique only within the same university
   (`409 COLLEGE_ID_TAKEN`).

`GET /auth/registration-config` is public. The register page hides Verify for a channel that is off, still calls `register/start`, and `register/complete` stores that channel as `email_verified` / `phone_verified: false` with `verification_required: false`. Turning a channel back on does not popup anyone by itself. `POST /super-admin/settings/registration/release` with `{ "batch_size": 20 }` marks the next oldest waiting students and evaluators (`verification_required: true`). It does not send OTP mail. On the next `POST /auth/login` or `GET /auth/me`, `verification_due.email` / `verification_due.mobile` is true only for a released account that still lacks a channel that is on now. The popup calls `POST /auth/verification/start`, the existing OTP routes, then `POST /auth/verification/complete`. Older accounts with a missing verified flag are treated as already verified.

OTP rate limits (Firestore `otp_rate_limits`): **5 sends/hour per email**, **2000/hour per IP** (campus NAT), 60s resend cooldown. Codes are hashed (SHA-256 + pepper).

### Forgot password

Unauthenticated. Same `verification_sessions` collection with `purpose: "password_reset"`:

1. `POST /auth/forgot-password/start` — **email only**. If the address is registered, email OTP is sent immediately; response includes `mobile_last4` (UI) and `mobile_number` (Firebase Phone Auth). Unknown email → `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`.
2. Reuse `POST /auth/email/send-otp`, `/email/verify-otp`, `/verify-phone-token`.
3. `POST /auth/forgot-password/reset` updates Firebase Auth password, revokes refresh tokens, deletes the session. **No login cookies** — user signs in again.

Register complete endpoints reject reset sessions (`PURPOSE_MISMATCH`).

---

## 8. Data stores

### Firestore collections

| Collection | Document | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| `users` | Firebase uid | Profile, `role` (`super_admin`, `admin`, `evaluator`, `student`, `custom`), `custom_role_id`, `approval_status`. Student Management pages with `GET /admin/users?page=1&page_size=15&role=student&q=`. Omitting `page` still returns the full non-admin array. `GET /admin/overview` returns the Overview counts and the newest five pending evaluators. |
| `roles` | role slug (`admin`, `student`, `theme-editor`) | Named roles and their permission keys. The built-in Admin and Student roles are seeded and cannot be edited. A custom role's document id is its name slug. Custom users store `role=custom` and `custom_role_id`. Assigning the Admin role stores `role=admin`. |

`DELETE /admin/access/users/{id}` removes an Admin or custom-role login from Firestore and Firebase Auth. A Super Admin account cannot be deleted.
| `application_logs` | generated id | Signed-in actions for Super Admin Application Logs. Each row has the user, operation, status, duration, and an IST `created_at`. Rows older than 7 days are removed. `GET /admin/access/logs` pages that window with search and filters. |
| `verification_sessions` | session id | Registration or password-reset OTP/phone state |
| `otp_rate_limits` | `email:…` / `ip:…` | Sliding-window OTP counters |
| `hackathons` | hackathon id | Timeline rounds, themes, export sheet ids |
| `hackathon_drafts` | draft id | Admin wizard drafts before publish |
| `hackathon_enrollments` | `{hackathonId}_{roundIndex}_{userId}` | One enrollment per user per round |
| `hackathon_teams` | team id | Round-scoped team + member ids |
| `team_join_codes` | code | 6-digit codes, ~5 minute TTL |
| `submissions` | submission id | Student work, scorecard, review, GitHub AI |
| `analysis` | submission id | Gemini video result (report, checklist, scores) |
| `themes` | theme id | Problem catalogue |
| `universities` | university id | Admin-created university (name, location, `college_type` `NIAT` or `Non NIAT`). A missing type is treated as NIAT |
| `batches` | batch id | Batch name scoped to one `university_id`. Register only lists that university's batches. |
| `evaluation_requirements` | requirement id | Rubric / form fields |
| `ai_evaluation_prompts` | prompt key | Gemini prompt templates |
| `ai_evaluation_metric_scoring` | scoring id | Metric scoring config |
| `app_settings` | `security`, `registration` | Profile Password, and email/mobile OTP toggles |
| `mail` | message id | Optional Trigger Email queue |

Firestore is not schema-enforced. Pydantic models validate **API** payloads; stored docs are dicts.

### GCS object layout

| Object | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `submissions/{student_id}/{submission_id}/video.{ext}` | Demo video |
| `hackathons/{hackathon_id}/banners/{id}.webp` | Card banner (resized WebP, `Cache-Control` ~5 days). List/catalog reuse a stored signed URL for up to ~6 days so the browser can cache it. |

The API issues **signed PUT** URLs for browser upload and **signed GET** URLs (or a streaming proxy) for playback. Gemini is given the `gs://` URI — the video is not re-downloaded into Cloud Run.

### Round flags (`hackathons.timeline[i]`)

Stored on `TimelineRound`:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `published` | Students can see and enroll |
| `team_size_mode` | `single` (one student), `multi` (`min_team_size` and `max_team_size`, each 2–6, equal allowed), or `open` (any size, including 1). Rounds saved before this field stay Solo (`max_team_size` 1) or a flexible 2–5 team (`max_team_size` 5). |
| `working_demo_video_required` | Video required vs form-only |
| `auto_ai_evaluation` | Queue Gemini on evaluator assign |
| `github_ai_evaluation` | Show GitHub AI button for evaluators |
| `leaderboard_published` | Students may `GET` the ranked board |

Super Admin can approve every evaluator-submitted review for one hackathon from Settings: `POST /hackathons/{id}/evaluation-approvals/approve-all`. Only `status=completed` and `review_status=pending_review` are approved, using the score already stored. Those rows become eligible for the leaderboard. The student-facing board still needs the existing per-round publish. Built-in Admin cannot call this route.

Hackathon visibility (`hackathons.visibility`) is set from Hackathon Settings, not at create time. `all_universities` and `all_batches` default to true, so existing hackathons stay on every student dashboard. A specific list is the intersection: the student's `university_id` and `batch_id` must both match. Select-all stays open to universities and batches created later. Students who do not match are omitted from `GET /hackathons` and the catalog, and `GET /hackathons/{id}`, enrollment, and submit return as if the hackathon does not exist (`404` or `NOT_VISIBLE`). Staff are not filtered. Anonymous catalog visitors only see hackathons with both select-all flags on.

Computed `round_status`: `draft` | `scheduled` | `open` | `closed` from the IST start and end clock. `start_time` and `end_time` are `HH:MM`. A missing time is `00:00` and `23:59`, so older hackathons stay open for the whole day. Submissions open at the start minute and stay open through the end minute, for both the hackathon and the round.

---

## 9. Domain flows

### 9.1 Hackathon lifecycle

```text
Admin draft  →  POST /hackathons

`POST /hackathons/{id}/duplicate` (admin or super admin) opens a draft filled from that hackathon: name with ` (copy)`, description, dates, guidelines, themes, prizes, rounds, and the banner. Rounds are unpublished and leaderboards are not published. Visibility, submission limit, report auto-publish, the evaluator roster, and video-analysis prompt overrides are stored on the draft and written onto the new hackathon when the draft is published. Submissions, teams, and scores stay on the original.
             →  Settings → Visibility (universities and batches; default is everyone)
             →  publish round (matching students can enroll)
             →  students enroll (solo or team)
             →  up to max_submissions per student/team per round (default 1, max 3)
             →  admin assigns evaluator(s)
             →  optional auto Gemini + optional GitHub AI
             →  evaluator submit-for-review
             →  admin approve (optional publish now / auto-publish)
             →  admin publish leaderboard (ranks + email)
```

### 9.2 Enrollment and teams

Per **hackathon + round index** (not per hackathon overall):

- Single (`team_size_mode` `single`, or legacy `max_team_size == 1`): `POST …/enroll/solo`
- Open (`team_size_mode` `open`): the same solo enroll, or a team of any size. The leader may submit with one or more members.
- Team: leader `POST …/teams/create` (name + 6-digit join code) → members `POST …/teams/join`
- `GET …/participation` drives the SPA (`can_submit`, `already_submitted`, `pending_action`, team completeness)

A leftover `role: solo` enrollment on a team round blocks `choose_role` until that enrollment is removed.

### 9.3 Submit once per round

Enforced in `app/services/submission/uniqueness.py` on `POST /submissions` and `POST /submissions/from-upload`:

- Same student + hackathon + round → `409 SUBMISSION_LIMIT_REACHED` once `max_submissions` is used (default 1, max 3, set on the hackathon)
- Same team (leader already submitted) → `409` with team message
- Other rounds remain independent
- Admin `POST /submissions/{id}/withdraw` deletes that submission, its analysis document, and its GCS video. The round slot is free again. Allowed only before an evaluator is assigned; AI analysis may already be done. Once `assigned_evaluator_id` is set, the call returns `409 SUBMISSION_ASSIGNED` and nothing is deleted. Students and evaluators cannot call it. A closed round still rejects a new submit.
- Super Admin `POST /super-admin/settings/hackathons/{id}/delete` removes that hackathon and every submission, analysis document, video, banner, team, enrollment, and join code stored for it. The body needs the Profile Password and `confirm_name` equal to the hackathon name. Student accounts stay. `GET /super-admin/settings/hackathons` and `GET /super-admin/settings/hackathons/{id}` fill the settings list and the confirm counts.

`GET /submissions/admin/hackathons/{id}?page=1&page_size=10` returns one page of that queue (`items`, `total`, `page`, `page_size`, `round_summary`). Optional filters are `round_index`, `status` (`uploaded` | `processing` | `completed` | `failed`), and `q` (team name, theme name, or submission id). `round_summary` counts every round and ignores status and search. `page_size` is at most 100. Omitting `page` still returns the full JSON array.

### 9.4 Video upload and Gemini evaluation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant S as Student
  participant API as FastAPI
  participant GCS as GCS
  participant CT as Cloud Tasks
  participant G as Gemini

  S->>API: POST /submissions/upload-url
  API-->>S: signed PUT URL
  S->>GCS: PUT video
  S->>API: POST /submissions/from-upload
  API->>API: uniqueness + Firestore submission
  Note over API: Admin assigns evaluator
  API->>CT: enqueue evaluate-submission
  CT->>API: POST /internal/jobs/evaluate-submission
  API->>G: gs:// video + rubric / prompts
  G-->>API: JSON scores + report
  API->>API: analysis doc + scorecard on submission
```

Status on the submission: `uploaded` → `processing` → `completed` | `failed`. The SPA polls `GET /submissions/{id}` (and `/analysis`, `/report` when allowed).

AI scorecard prompts may include `{problem_statement}`, `{solution_description}`, `{theme}` (selected theme **description**), and `{theme_name}`. Tokens are interpolated from the submission at evaluation time. `{theme}` / `{Theme}` chips come from `GET /evaluation-requirements/{id}/scoring-setup`. Submissions snapshot `theme_description` on create.

Locally (`EVALUATION_JOB_MODE=auto` without queue config) the same `evaluate_submission` runs as a FastAPI `BackgroundTask`. That path **does not survive process restart**. Production uses Cloud Tasks and Cloud Run `--timeout=3600`.

### 9.5 Scoring, review, leaderboard

1. Evaluator fills the scorecard → `review_status=pending_review` and `final_score`.
2. Admin `approve-evaluation` → `approved`. The report stays hidden unless `publish_now` is true or the hackathon `auto_publish_reports` setting is on. `POST /submissions/{id}/publish` releases one approved report later.
3. `PUT /hackathons/{id}/report-publishing` with `auto_publish_reports: true` publishes every already-approved hidden report in the same request (Firestore batches, no Cloud Tasks) and auto-publishes later approvals.
4. Admin may `request-changes` back to the evaluator.
5. Leaderboard ranks **approved** submissions by `final_score` using competition ranking (100, 90, 90, 80 → 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th).
6. Students get `403 LEADERBOARD_NOT_PUBLISHED` until `POST …/leaderboard/publish`. Admins and evaluators can preview earlier.
7. Publishing the leaderboard does not send email. Students see the Leaderboard section on the hackathon after they sign in.
8. Super Admin `POST /hackathons/{id}/rounds/{index}/winners/announce` with `{ "top_n": 5 }` emails that many places. Rank 1 is Winner (1st prize), rank 2 is 1st runner-up (2nd prize), rank 3 is 2nd runner-up, and the rest are 4th, 5th, and so on. Ties at the cutoff are included. The board must already be published.

Each hackathon stores `evaluator_ids`. Create copies every currently approved evaluator. `GET/PUT /hackathons/{id}/evaluators` is the Settings roster. Submission assign and divide-equally only accept ids on that roster. Hackathons saved before this field still allow any approved evaluator until an admin saves the roster.

### 9.6 GitHub AI (optional)

When the round has `github_ai_evaluation` and the submission has a GitHub URL:

1. Evaluator `POST /submissions/{id}/evaluate-github-ai` → `202`
2. Gemini builds `{ provided_context, rubrics[] }` from problem/solution
3. Backend `POST`s the analyser `/analyze`, then polls `GET /analyze/{job_id}` (wait up to 120s per poll)
4. `result.scoring.total_score` is stored on the GitHub scorecard metric (`github_ai_status`)

The SPA never calls the analyser. Manual GitHub scoring still works if the flag is off.

---

## 10. Asynchronous evaluation jobs

`EvaluationJobService` (`EVALUATION_JOB_MODE`):

| Mode | When | Behaviour |
|------|------|-----------|
| `cloud_tasks` | Explicit, or `auto` when queue + target URL + secret + project are set | Enqueue HTTP task |
| `background` | Explicit, or `auto` when Cloud Tasks is not configured | FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` |

Worker: `POST /internal/jobs/evaluate-submission` with `X-Internal-Job-Secret`. Non-2xx responses make Cloud Tasks retry (transient Gemini/GCS failures). Invalid secret → 401 (no retry storm of unauthorized tasks if the secret is wrong — Tasks will still retry; keep the secret aligned).

GitHub AI currently runs as an in-process background task on the evaluate-github-ai request (same 202 + poll pattern), not via Cloud Tasks.

---

## 11. External integrations

| System | Role | Config |
|--------|------|--------|
| Firebase Auth | Login, phone verify, Admin token verify, user CRUD | `FIREBASE_*` |
| Firestore | All metadata | same service account |
| GCS | Videos, banners, signed URLs | `EVALUATION_BUCKET_NAME` |
| Gemini | Checklist, video scores, GitHub context | `GEMINI_MODEL`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, `GEMINI_ENTERPRISE` |
| GitHub analyser | Repo score | `GITHUB_AI_EVALUATION_URL` |
| Brevo SMTP | OTP + leaderboard email | `EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp`, `SMTP_*` |
| Cloud Tasks | Durable video jobs | `CLOUD_TASKS_*`, `INTERNAL_JOB_SECRET` |
| Google Sheets / Drive | Admin submission export | `GOOGLE_SHEETS_EXPORT_FOLDER_ID`; share folder with `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` |

---

## 12. Errors, CORS, and concurrency

- `AppError` → status + `{ detail }` or `{ detail: { code, message } }` when `code` is set (`ALREADY_SUBMITTED`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `LEADERBOARD_NOT_PUBLISHED`, …).
- Uncaught `ValueError` → 400 / 404 / 409 / 413 from message text.
- Unhandled `Exception` → 500 `"Internal server error"` (stack logged).
- `InfrastructureError` → 503 with a generic client body.

CORS: explicit `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `allow_credentials=True`. Cross-origin production (`COOKIE_SAMESITE=none`) requires HTTPS and CSRF via login JSON or `GET /auth/csrf`.

Cloud Run: **1 GiB / 1 CPU / 3600s timeout**, `--allow-unauthenticated` (auth is application-level). Scale and concurrency are ops concerns (campus OTP bursts: raise `--max-instances` / `--concurrency` rather than tightening per-IP OTP).

---

## 13. Deployment

## 15. What this is not

- The old prototype paths `/upload-video`, `/analyze-video`, and `evaluation_sessions` are **not** the product. Live evaluation is **hackathon submissions**.
- `CLAUDE.md` may still describe that prototype; prefer this document and `app/main.py`.
- No in-app notification inbox — email is OTP and leaderboard publish.
- In-process `BackgroundTasks` (local video AI, GitHub AI) are lost on Cloud Run instance restart.

For endpoint-level frontend contracts, see the README “Frontend handoff” sections (rounds/teams, GitHub AI, leaderboard, drafts, export, CSRF).
